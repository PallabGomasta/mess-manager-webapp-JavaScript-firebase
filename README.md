1. Explanation of Existing Systems
•	Google Sheets
Google Sheets is a versatile, cloud-based tool often used for mess management in student dormitories, shared apartments, and households. It allows users to maintain expense records, calculate meal rates, and share real-time updates with members. While flexible, it requires manual setup of formulas and lacks built-in features for automated role management, member control, or secure authentication.

•	Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Excel is another widely used solution for managing hostel or mess systems. Users can track expenses, meal counts, and balances through spreadsheets. However, it is not collaborative in real time (unless integrated with cloud services), and manual intervention is needed for updates, making it less efficient.

2. Scope of Our Work
The proposed Mess Management Online System is a web-based application designed to overcome the limitations of spreadsheet-based systems. It provides:
•	Expense Tracking – Record and manage all mess-related expenses with transparency.
•	Daily Meal Tracking – Update and monitor meals consumed by each member.
•	Meal Rate Calculation – Automatically compute the meal rate based on total meals and expenses.
•	Individual Cost & Balance – Track each member’s contribution, cost, balance.
•	Role Management – Assign or change manager roles, add/remove members.
•	Messaging Feature – Built-in chat/messaging option for real-time mess updates.
•	User-Friendly Interface – Simple, hassle-free, and easily accessible from any device.
This system ensures accuracy, transparency, and efficiency in mess operations, reducing dependency on manual calculations while fostering collaboration among members.
